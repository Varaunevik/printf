# printf
This is my implementation of the printf function, including precision, width and flags (aka. the bonus, if you're a 42 student).<br>
Yes, I know it's unnecessarily long and maybe not the nicest looking piece of work, but hey - at least it's working!<br>
This is very much a DIY project, but maybe it can give you some inspiration. <br>
