# printf
Recreating the printf function (bonus included)
This is my implementation of the printf function, including precision, width and flags (aka. the bonus, if you're a 42 student). 
Yes, I know it's unnecessarily long and maybe not the nicest looking piece of work, but hey - at least it's working!
